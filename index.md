## What is DevOps? 


DevOps is a software development strategy which bridges the gap between the development and operations teams within an organization. Is not a tool or a programming language. There are developers ‘devs’ and operations ‘ops’ and they work  together to ensure quality. DevOps is a software development approach that involves development, testing, integration, deployment and monitoring throughout the development process.
